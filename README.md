# Code and Digital Technology Narrative

Hello students! This multimodal coding project is a great way for you to learn how to work with code and develop your own literacies, computational thinking skills, and computer science knowledge.

By working through the prompts in the index.html file, you will construct your own multimodal project relating your code and technology narrative.  

This beginner template allows the you to mix and match code blocks should you wish to further customize your work. It's a great introduction to code that will prepare you to use other Pitt Fuego Coding Tools

Go to [Pitt Fuego](https://pitt-fuego.github.io/Pitt-Fuego-Coding-Tools/) to find more code-based tools and projects.<p>&nbsp;</p>

    
## Get started!


1. Scroll to the top of this repository and click the green "**Code**" button. Select "**Download ZIP**" to download project files to your local computer. These are all the project files you'll need to get started working with code.

2. Find this project folder in your downloads and move it to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your files and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

3. Download and/or open a code editor. We recommend  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (See download and setup instructions below).

4. Use the code editor to open your project folder. Open index.html document. Read through the code comments embedded in the index.html document. Here, you'll find all the information you need to work with code! 

5. Once you have modified and added content to your project, you will want to publish your webtext to the internet. GitHub provides a good publishing solution. If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account. [Go to GitHub](https://github.com/)

6. Create a new repository to house your project files. Click  "**uploading an existing file**" and upload your project files to your repository and "**Commit changes**". You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. 

7. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to **"GitHub Pages"** in the left-hand menu. Change the source setting from **"none"** to **"main" "/root"** and then Click "Save"

8. GitHub will now provide you with a published URL. (This process may take several minutes.)

9. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
