<!--Glitch a .jpg image by editing the source code. Open the digital image file using “text/edit” on Macs (located in Launchpad/other), "Notepad" on Windows, or "text" on Chromebooks (located in App launcher). Make a test glitch: scroll down to the middle of the document. Copy, cut, move, and paste 10-20 lines of code. Hit save. Then open the original image to see what has changed. Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg." If an image is larger than 1200px in width, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image".

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> My name is Zoey and I'm from Pennington New Jersey. I'm on the pre-med track but I want to transfer to nursing. I've never coded before until this porject, I did not enjoy it. My first experience with technology that I clearly remember was an iPad mini. I used to make vlogs with my brother and friends and I accidentally bought a lot of games.   </p>

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->

  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Code and digital technology has changed learning because it added new skills like coding and using online tools, not just reading and writing. Now we learn in more interactive ways like through videos and apps. It's important to think about code in digital literacy because we can understand and shape the technology we use all the time, instead of being controlled by it. </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with technology</h2>
    <p>I used to think that AI would never advance enough to take over the world, but now I see how much progress it is actually making. I've seen a lot of AI-generated videos, and some people do not immediately catch that it was AI. This development has changed my view and made me realize that AI will just continue to advance and be a part of our everyday lives. Kurzwell mentions that technology will become so advanced that it will hardly differ from human intelligence. This is something I never believed would happen.
